This repository is a personal playground for diving deep into the world of neural networks and understanding them from the ground up. Here, you'll find Python implementations of various neural network algorithms built entirely from scratch. These implementations are designed to help me (and hopefully you) grasp the fundamental concepts of neural networks, their architectures, and the intricate mathematics behind them.
